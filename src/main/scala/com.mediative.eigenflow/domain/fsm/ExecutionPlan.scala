/**
 * ExecutionPlan is a linked data structure which describes:
 * - stage transitions
 * - error handling strategy per stage
 * - custom messages for publishing
 *
 * @param stage The stage the plan describes.
 * @param f Stage business logic.
 * @param from Deserializer from String to A.
 *             Where the string is a serialized result of the previous stage and A is expected input type for this stage.
 * @param to Serializer from B to String. Serializes the execution result of this stage to String.
 * @param previous Link to previous stage. None for the first stage.
 * @param recoveryStrategy A strategy to handle exceptions thrown during stage execution.
 *                      If no strategy defined for a particular exception the stage will fail.
 * @param recoveryTimeout Time limit for the stage retries.
 *                       When one retry strategy is defined it's fairly easy to calculate timeout:
 *                         ~ (interval + stage_execution_time_before_exception) * number_of_times
 *                       If multiple strategies are defined and different exceptions are thrown time to time
 *                       the total timeout will be a sum of all timeouts. To limit this value globally use
 *                       this timeout parameter, it will stop retrying even if not all attempts are made.
 *
 *                       If timeout reached the stage fails.
 *
 *                       Note: this timeout will NOT interrupt a normal run, it will only have effect on recovery.
 * @param publishMetricsMap A map which allows to calculate different values based on the stage execution result and
 *                          publish those values to the given topic. Typical use case is publishing some execution
 *                          statistical data, like number of records processed or size of file downloaded etc.
 * @tparam A Expected input data type.
 * @tparam B Stage execution result type.
